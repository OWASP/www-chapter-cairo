**OWASP TOP 10 AWARENESS - DAY 9: USING COMPONENTS WITH KNOWN VULNERABILITIES**
.	
Date: Thursday 5th of March 2020

While some known vulnerabilities lead to only minor impacts, some of the largest breaches to date have relied on exploiting known vulnerabilities in components. Component-heavy development patterns can lead to development teams not even understanding which components they use in their application or API, much less keeping them up to date. The day 9 includes two sessions covering the relevent web attacks and attacks mitigation.

Date: Thursday 5th of March 2020
